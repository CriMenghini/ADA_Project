# modERN : mod-EPFL Researchers Network

*modERN* is a project that is going to be developed during the next months. It has the presumption of proposing a *mod* description, analysis and exploration of the *EPFL Researchers Network*. In order to make it as much *mod* as possible, many techniques, that represent the *state of the art* in the graph theory, are used. Furthermore, the data viz tools will help us in illustrating the results of the analysis.

Stay tuned, the best is coming!

But, what is [*mod*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(subculture)) exactly?

      "the mass media often used the term mod in a wider sense to describe anything that was believed to be popular, fashionable or modern."


## Abstract

We present *modERN*, both an analysis of the research community of the EPFL, a university recognised as an excellence in terms of research, 
and a visual exploration of the *white hot* topics which the research is addressed to. *modERN* focuses its attention on discovering which 
departments collaborate and share information, how the interactions between groups change over time and the influence of one on the other. 
Using different data sources *modERN* estimates the potential of researches carried out at the EPFL, 
whether they are acknowledged by the scientific community, and guesses the researchers that will work on certain topics in the future.
