1. Load graph to NetwrokX
2. Calculate stats (degree, betweenness and eigenvector centrality) and save values as node attributes in the graph
3. Reduce number of nodes using eigendecomposition od adjacency matrix
4. Community detection using Louvain's algorithm

5. Export graph from Networkx in JSON format with nodes with attributes and edges
6. Visualize with D3.

5'. Export graph from Networkx in dot format: networkx.write_dot(G, 'file.dot')
6'. Import file.dot into Gephi and use the force atlas 2 layout algorithm. Prevent overlapping nodes. Adjust styling
7'. Export a GEXF file from Gephi
8'. Visualize with sigmajs on website

Scale font size using betweenness
