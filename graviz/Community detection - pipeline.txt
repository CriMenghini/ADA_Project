1. Load graph to NetwrokX
2. Calculate stats (degree, betweenness and eigenvector centrality) and save values as node attributes in the graph
3. Reduce number of nodes using eigendecomposition od adjacency matrix
4. Community detection using Louvain's algorithm
5. Export graph from NetworkX in JSON format with nodes with attributes and edges
6. Visualize graph.

(optional) 7. Scale font size using betweenness
