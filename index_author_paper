## Prepare data to build the basic graph (nodes, edges). 

_Main Idea_: create an inverted index for Researchers and papers. 

1. Create a `.csv` file that matches the title of a work to the paper ID. The file stores what follows:
        
                                _Paper ID_            _Title_
                                     1                Network
                                     .                  .
                                     .                  .
                                     n                Bridge
                                     
2. Create a `.csv` file that matches the name of a researcher to the researcher ID. The file stores what follows:

                                 _Author ID_         _Author_
                                     1                John
                                     .                  .
                                     .                  .
                                     n                Rose
                                     
The two steps above are useful to make the inverted index less heavy.

3. Create the inverted index:

                                _Author ID_             _List papers_
                                    1                   1,3,4,5,7,9,19
                                    
                                    
                                    
Once we have the inverted index we can built the first graph. In particular:
- To each author will correspond a node
- Two nodes are linked whether the published together a paper. In particular, we will compute the intersections between the lists.
If the *intersection* is not empty, we will draw the edge whose *weigth* will be the `len` of the intersection: the number of
common pubblications of the two researchers.
